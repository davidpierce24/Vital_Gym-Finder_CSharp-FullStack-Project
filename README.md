# Vital - a C# .NET app for finding gyms

This is an app I had been wanting to make for years, and I felt like I was finally capable when I learned C# .NET. This app is supposed to be similar to Yelp, but specifically catered to gym owners and gym goers. Gym owners can create an account / page for their gym / gyms that users can go look at to learn more about the gym. It's similar to a social media profile. The owner can add the gym address, hours, equipment, classes and eventually other information. It has full CRUD functionality and is, but still needs a few additions. I think it would be much closer to a finished product if owners could add pictures and users could add their location and see gyms catered toward their current area.

## Tools Used
